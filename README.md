## Update will be available soon

I am committed to developing a comprehensive how-to/informational project that goes beyond mere code demonstrations. This project will feature practical implementations in plain HTML, ReactTS, and Angular, showcasing multiple approaches to implementing Sticky Navigation, ranging from straightforward to more intricate methods.

### A BOOTSTRAP ANIMATED STICKY NAVIGATION

History
There are many out there, but all of them have only parts that I need so I figured I pick out the good parts of all of them and make my own.

This is the Navigation bar that will stay on top and animates into a different style after scrolling. It has a mitigation for navbars that have CMS admin bars preceding it.
