A BOOTSTRAP ANIMATED STICKY NAVIGATION

History
There are many out there, but all of them have only parts that I need so I figured I pick out the good parts of all of them and make my own.

This is the Navigation bar that will stay on top and animates into a different style after scrolling. It has a mitigation for navbars that have CMS admin bars preceding it.
